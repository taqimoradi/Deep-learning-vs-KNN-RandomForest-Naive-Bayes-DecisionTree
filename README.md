# Deep-learning-vs-KNN-RandomForest-Naive-Bayes-DecisionTree
 compare classification implementation using Deep learning . KNN  , Decision Tree , Naive Bayes  and Random forest 
 The given dataset contains details about organic chemical compounds including their chemical features, isomeric conformation, names and the classes in which they are classified. The compounds are classified as either ‘Musk’ or ‘Non-Musk’ compounds. Your task is to build a classification model on the given data using any Deep Learning approach ,KNN  , Decision Tree , Naive Bayes  and Random forest
